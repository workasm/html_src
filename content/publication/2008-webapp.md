abstract = "A web application is presented to compute, plot, and interactively explore planar arrangements induced by algebraic plane curves of arbitrary degree. It produces accurate curve plots and reflects the exact topology for any arrangement, including degenerated cases. Various user interface features allow the interactive exploration of the arrangement structure. This makes the tool useful for demonstrative and educational purposes, especially as it runs without initial installation process."
